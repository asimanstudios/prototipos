## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#9D4EDD), drawing inspiration from royalty and leadership roles while avoiding cliche.
- Background color: A very light purple (#F5EEF8) provides a clean, soft backdrop.
- Accent color: A saturated pink (#EE4266), which serves to draw attention and create contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif which gives a machined, neutral look and works well for both headings and body text.
- Simple, modern icons to represent different staff roles and actions.
- Clean, tabular layout for displaying staff information, with clear distinctions between roles and statuses.
- Subtle transitions when switching between different staff sections or when editing entries.
